Device IoT, which allows you to control the color and brightness of the R\+GB L\+ED. To manage the L\+ED, the state machine was implemented in which the further development of the project is envisaged. So, the L\+ED is controlled by commands like\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \char`\"{}c135\char`\"{} -\/ sets the red L\+ED to half power;
\item \char`\"{}b55\char`\"{} -\/ sets the brightness of white to a maximum;
\item \char`\"{}f\char`\"{} -\/ turns on the mode of smooth color change of the L\+ED.
\end{DoxyItemize}

All management is done through an application in which all these commands are already implemented in a convenient graphical interface. You can also control the L\+ED using the U\+A\+RT interface, which uses bluetooth.
